# Vex-Byte-NMC
Repository for the UF Vex Club "Byte" NMC team 

### Getting Stated

Hey there! You'll need the `PROS v0.6.0` visual studio extension to get started.

As we'll be working out of one file, please pull before working on any code, and push before closing the repository so the repo is always up to date (unless you REALLY want to deal with some nasty merge conflicts, then idk do whatever ig).
